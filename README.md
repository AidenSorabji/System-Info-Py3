# System-Info - Py3
A cool little python script that can read your system, and network and give that info to you

# Compatability
This python code works, and works only with python 3 - was tested on python 3.10, so not sure if it will work with earlier versions.

# Commands

`sys` - Tells you your system (ex. Darwin)

`net` - Tells you your computers network name

`platform` - Tells you your platform (ex. windows, macos, linux)

`machine` - Tells you your arch (x86)

`win_ed` - Tells you your windows edition (ex. enterprise)

And more! - If you want to see other commands, you can now type `cmds` to see the other commands you can do.

# Help
If you are encountering issues, please try to following:

**Re-download the code**

**Make sure your on the right version of python**

**Make sure your using a proper IDE**

~One of the causes of the python script not working or not working *properly* is if you are running the script in terminal. If you are running it in terminal, the python code will not work (for some reason lmao).~

You can now use it in terminal lmao, just type the following command (for macOS users only) `python3 *directory of py file*`
